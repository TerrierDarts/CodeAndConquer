### My Journey into Game Development: Update 1  

I’ve decided to take on the challenge of learning how to make a game. In this first update, I’m going to share my thoughts and feelings from the past month to month and a half of this journey, along with a bit of background about what came before I actually started developing. Future updates will dive deeper into what I’ve learned, the problems I’ve faced, and the steps I took to overcome them.  

Learning to develop a game has been tough so far, but the progress I’ve made feels incredible. I’d be lying if I said I opened Godot and did nothing. On the contrary, I think I’ve learned quite a lot. In this short period, I’ve been able to lay the foundation for a game, and I’ve set up plans to teach myself as much as I can by creating opportunities to learn.  

For example, when I wanted to understand how collision works, I added a collectable item to my game. This has become the best way for me to learn identify something I want to understand, figure out how it could be applied, and then implement it directly in my game.

One thing I think is important to highlight is that I’m not expecting this to be the greatest game ever made. In fact, I’m completely fine knowing that this game is going to be trash so will the next one, and probably the one after that. But I’m confident that each game will get better and better. That’s the process of learning. This is exactly why my “dream game” isn’t even a thought at the moment. I want to gain as much experience and knowledge as possible before I even consider tackling that dream game.  

Another thing I didn’t spend much time worrying about was which engine to use. To me, it just didn’t matter. If you’re an experienced game developer with years of practice and dozens of completed games under your belt, the choice of engine might be a big deal. Maybe you’d even want to create your own.  

> **If you’re new, don’t build your own engine. Learn how to walk before you try to run.**  

I chose Godot mainly because, on the surface, it looked more user-friendly and so far, that’s proven true. I’ve hit plenty of roadblocks, but I’ve managed to overcome most of them. One of the most frustrating lessons I’ve learned is this: sometimes when I want to do A and B, I know how to do A, and I know how to do B, but I just can’t figure out how to make A and B work together. However, for me, that’s all part of the fun.  

### The State of My Game  

So, where is my game currently? Here’s a list of everything I’ve managed to add so far:  

- Moveable character  
- Several levels and a way to move between them  
- A single-item inventory box  
- Multi-language support  
- Collectable items  
- A chest that requires a key  
- Opening the chest causes another item to spawn  

I know that list sounds basic, but that’s okay. This is where I’m at right now, and it’s important to remember that even small victories are still victories. They’re something to be proud of, and I am.
