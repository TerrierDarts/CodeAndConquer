### The What and the Why

As the title suggests, I’ve finally finished my game! While there were some bugs early on, I believe I’ve fixed most of them. Releasing this game is a huge milestone in my game dev journey — everyone remembers their first. It might not be to everyone's taste, and of course, people will have creative criticism, but overall, the initial feedback has been really positive, which is great to see. 

There are definitely things I could have done better, but there are also areas where I think I did really well. For example, I’m proud of the core concept. Even though it’s a small game, it worked the way I wanted. The main complaint I received was about one specific part, but honestly, I was happy that the whole game wasn’t too obvious or too easy.

So, what did I build? I made what I’m calling a Platform Trade-Up Puzzle game. The goal is simple: get Item A, use that to get Item B, which helps you get Item C, and so on. The game is called **Lost: Quest for the Blue Diamond**, and if you want to play it, you can check it out [here](https://terrierdarts.itch.io/lost-quest-for-the-blue-diamond). (The itch.io page also includes some spoilers and hints if you get stuck.)

As for why I built this game — the short answer is because I wanted to. But the real reason was about building skills, not just building a game. I believe it's important to sort out the fundamentals before trying to make something I could actually sell. Without a strong foundation, any serious project would be set up to fail, and it wouldn’t be a true reflection of what I'm capable of. When the time comes for that dream project, I want to be ready. Until then, the plan is to keep making small games and learning big skills!

### What's Next for Me

In short: another project! I’m not sure what it will be yet, but like this one, it’ll be focused on learning, not just making something impressive. Right now, building skills and expanding my knowledge base is the priority.

### Lessons I’ll Take Into My Next Project

- Proper naming schemes are incredibly helpful.
- Having confidence in what I’m doing makes a big difference.
- With more experience in GDScript, I hope to write cleaner, more efficient code.

### Final Thoughts

I know this post is short and sweet, but I think it’s important to jot down my thoughts and feelings after finishing a project like this. It gives me something to look back on and also keeps anyone following my journey in the loop.

Overall, I think this game has been a real success for a first project. Here’s hoping the second one can be just as good — or even better!
